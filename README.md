# gromarks
Simple python package for creating scripts to run GROMACS benchmarks.

## Installation

There are no package dependencies so on your local machine simply clone the repository 

    $ git clone https://github.com/philipwfowler/gromarks.git
    $ cd gromarks/

##Â Usage

The configuration of the machine you wish to benchmark on is described in a JSON file e.g. the new F RESCOMP nodes are here

    $ cat config/machines/rescomp.F.json 
    { "id":"rescomp.F",
      "gpu-number": 0,
      "core-number": 40,
      "core-simd": "AVX512",
      "gromacs":
        {
          "version": "2018.2",
          "path": "/apps/well/gromacs/2018.2-avx512-gcc5.4.0/bin/GMXRC",
          "mpi": 1
        }
      }

This will create a `run.sh` script to run a series of short GROMACS 2018.2 benchmark simulations up to 40 cores in size. There are no GPUs on these nodes.

Three different TPR files are included. These are `dhfr.tpr`, `rpob.tpr` and `peptst.tpr`. They all refer to protein names and are different sizes.

At present the package has two scripts

    $ gromarks-create.py --help
    usage: gromarks-create.py [-h] [--id ID] [--protein PROTEIN]

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help         show this help message and exit
      --id ID            the name of the JSON describing the machine configuration
                         e.g. rescomp.F
      --protein PROTEIN  the name of the benchmarking TPR file e.g.
                         dhfr/rpob/peptst

and 

    $ gromarks-analyse.py --help
    usage: gromarks-analyse.py [-h] [--id ID] [--protein PROTEIN]
    
    optional arguments:
      -h, --help         show this help message and exit
      --id ID            the name of the JSON describing the machine configuration
                         e.g. rescomp.F
      --protein PROTEIN  the name of the b

Running the first will create a folder inside the repository (I know, bad practice, but will fix this later to keep the package separate) which contains a single `run.sh` that will copy in the specified TPR file and then run GROMACS. No batch queueing system files are created at present - this will also be fixed later!

    $ gromarks-create.py --id rescomp.F --protein dhfr
    $ ls dhfr-rescomp.F/
    run.sh
    $ head dhfr-rescomp.F/run.sh 
    #! /bin/bash
  
    source /apps/well/gromacs/2018.2-avx512-gcc5.4.0/bin/GMXRC
    
    cp ../config/tpr-files/dhfr.tpr dhfr_rescomp.F_2018.2_1_0_1.tpr
    mpirun -np 1 mdrun_mpi -deffnm dhfr_rescomp.F_2018.2_1_0_1 -ntomp 1 -resethway -maxh 0.1 -noconfout -pin on
    
    cp ../config/tpr-files/dhfr.tpr dhfr_rescomp.F_2018.2_1_0_2.tpr
    mpirun -np 1 mdrun_mpi -deffnm dhfr_rescomp.F_2018.2_1_0_2 -ntomp 2 -resethway -maxh 0.1 -noconfout -pin on

The `-resethway` flag is short for reset timers at halfway which prevents the launch cycle influencing the timing. `-noconfout` stops GROMACS writing out a GRO file when the simulation terminates as this can also affect the timing. Finally, `-maxh 0.1` specifies that each sim will only run for 6 minutes before dying, 3 minutes of which is timed and recorded at the end of the LOG file. The collection of log files is then analysed using the other command (still in the root directory of the package)

    $ gromarks-analyse.py --protein dhfr --id rescomp.F
              rescomp.F,      40,            -,     2018.2,   1,   0,    2.05,     4.13,     7.56,    13.27,    18.31,    19.33, 
              rescomp.F,      40,            -,     2018.2,   2,   0,    4.08,     7.10,    12.08,    15.83,    18.09, 
              rescomp.F,      40,            -,     2018.2,   4,   0,    7.45,    12.75,    17.15,    23.83, 
              rescomp.F,      40,            -,     2018.2,   8,   0,   13.18,    17.48,    26.67, 
              rescomp.F,      40,            -,     2018.2,  16,   0,   17.70,    27.77, 
              rescomp.F,      40,            -,     2018.2,  32,   0,   28.17, 

This can of course be redirected to a (csv) file. The vertical axis is the number of MPI threads, whereas the horizontal axis is the number of OpenMP processes per MPI thread, all in doubling series starting at 1! Hence 1 MPI thread with 32 OpenMP processes (top right) achieves 19.3 ns/day, whereas 32 MPI threads, each with 1 OpenMP process (bottom left), is faster at 28.2 ns/day.

## Todo

- rewrite as classes to abstract logic
- add `pkg_resources` so machines and tpr-files can be read outside the packages
- add functionality for producing a series of batch queueing scripts, inplace of the simple `run.sh` script! Again use JSON.
